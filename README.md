# perfSONAR Scratch Repository

This repostitory exists for experimentation with Git and GitHub.
Nothing in it should be taken seriously for any purpose.

-----

There is a hook installed which checks for the presence of a file
named `BRANCH-CLOSED` in the top of the repository.  The presence of
this file indicates that no more commits should be done in the branch.
